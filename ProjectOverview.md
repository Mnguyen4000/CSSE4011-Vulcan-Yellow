# Project and Scenario Description (e.g. what is the project)

# at least 5 Key Performance Indicators- how is the ’success’ of the project measured?

# System Overview (Hardware Architecture- block diagram of the system, Top-level flowchart of software implementation (mote and PC).

# Sensor Integration- What sensors are used? What type of data is required? How are the sensors integrated?

# Wireless Network Communication or IoT protocols/Web dashboards- e.g. What is the network topology or IoT protocols used? What protocols are used and how?, What sort of data rate is required? You must also include a message protocol diagram.

# Algorithms schemes used- e.g. Machine learning approaches

# DIKW Pyramid abstraction. Provide a scenario in which your system can operate. Consider what DIKW Pyramid layers that your system can contribute to.
